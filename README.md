# Project_CPGE_TIPE
My TIPE in CPGE about electrolysis of nitrate ions in water
Before the end of the trials i've planned to be an engineer in chemistry...
During my studies in CPGE, I was majoring in physics and chemistry and we had to do a project during 2 years about the topic "societal issues"
Therefore, with my collegue BIDAULT Martin (an ENSTA Paris' student), we chose the project electrolysis of nitrate ions in water.
We had to do theorical and experience about this subject. 

First read MCOT, it's the project's summary then you can read the diapo where there is few texts because it was an oral.

I had 9.8/20 and my friend 14/20.
